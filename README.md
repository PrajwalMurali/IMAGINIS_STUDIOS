 How I Built This Using Cursor AI

This website was designed using **Cursor AI**, an AI-powered coding assistant. Here's how I used specific prompts to build different sections:

 1. Navbar and Branding

**Prompt Used:**

> "Create a responsive navbar with links: About Us, Our Services, Gallery, and Contact. The brand title should be 'IMAGINIS STUDIOS ðŸŽ¥âœ¨'. Make the design dark-themed and modern."

**AI Output:**
A complete navbar with dark styling and hover effects, fixed to the top.

2. Hero Section

**Prompt Used:**

> "Design a hero section with a background image or animation. Add a circular image/logo in the center, with a heading 'IMAGINIS STUDIOS ðŸŽ¥âœ¨' and a subheading that invites users to explore a photography portfolio."

**AI Output:**
The hero section includes a glowing futuristic tunnel background, center logo, and stylized text.

3. About Us Section

**Prompt Used:**

> "Add an 'About Us' section below the hero with a short paragraph describing our passion for photography and videography. Use clean and readable fonts with center alignment."

**AI Output:**
A centered paragraph with clear messaging and simple layout, ideal for introducing the team.
